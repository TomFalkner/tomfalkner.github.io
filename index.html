	<h1>Tom Falkner</h1>
	<p>
	    I am a senior full stack developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://pollinate.com/">pollinate</a> where
	    I spend my days as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spectrumcustomizer.com/">Spectrum Customizer</a>
	    platform team.</p>

	<p>I have extensive frontend experience and I have implemented
	projects using Vue and Angular. I take performance seriously
	and am regularly tasked with taking memory heavy and CPU
	intensive projects and finding a way for them to run on
	impossibly old mobile phones.</p>

	<p>I also work on server side projects using node and .net.</p>
